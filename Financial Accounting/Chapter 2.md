## Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
   Explain the company's accounting assumptions and practices
2. Additional information about the summary totals found in the financial statements
3. Disclosure of important information that is not recognized in the financial statements
	   Disclosure is the accepted way to convey information to users **when the information is too uncertain to be recognized**.
	1. Recognition: 
	   Include the estimates and judgements in the financial statements. The key assumptions and estimates are described in a note to the financial statements.
	2. Disclosure:
	   Not include the estimates and judgements in the financial statements. Instead, they are explained in the notes to the financial statements.
4. Supplementary information required by the IASB

## The External Audit
- A company's financial statements are often audited by an independent certified public accountant
- The accuracy of the statements must remain the responsibility of the company's management
- Audited financial statements are required before a company can sell securities, like shares, stocks, and bonds, to the general public
- The audit firms are hired and paid by the company being audited, but we can trust the quality of the audit because...
	- Reputation: It would be reluctant to rish the audit firm's reputation by signing off on questionable statements
	- Lawsuits: Auditors are being sued all the time (by investors) even when they conduct  good audit. An auditor who intentionally approves a false set of financial statements is at great risk of losing a big lawsuit

## Fundamental Concepts and Assumptions
- **The separate entity concept** ^separate-entity
    - An entity is considered to be separate from its individual owners
    - Entity: The organizational unit for which accounting records are maintained
- **The time-period assumption** ^time-period-assumption
    - The idea used to report the results of activities over a standard time period (monthly, quarterly, annually)
    - Users can be informed of the company's financial position, operating performance, and cash flows in a timely manner
- <b>The assumption of <mark style="--col: var(--hyellow);">arm's-length transactions</mark></b> ^arms-length
    - Both parties are rational and free to act independently, each trying to make the best deal possible in establishing the terms of the transaction
    - Transactions: Exchanges of economic resources between separate entities AND events that have an economic impact on a business independently, like the loss in value of equipment due to obsolescence or fire
    - Arm's-length transactions: Business dealings between independent and **rational parties** who are **looking out for their own interests**
- **The cost principle** ^cost-principle
    - Record transactions at historical cost, the amount originally paid or received for goods and services in arm's-length transactions
- **The fair value principle** ^fair-value
    - Assets and liabilities be measured at fair value so that the relevance of accounting information can be improved
    - Fair value: Market value of stocks, valuation of property, plant, and equipment
- **The monetary measurement concept** ^monetary
    - Record only those that can be measured in monetary terms, whether or not cash is involved
- **The going concern assumption** ^going-concern
    - Assumption that the company would continue in business for the foreseeable future
    - Allows the accountant to record assets at what they are worth to a company in normal use, rather than what they would sell for in a liquidation sale
